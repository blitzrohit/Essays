            <p> This is a project page where I muse about what I think about psychology and anything to do with the mind.</p>

	     <p>It's surprising how you may be forced into an interlude of compulsive thinking on random mornings.
You are sitting there enjoying a good hot cup of your favourite drink with an empty mind. 
Probably,the only things on your mind are the fragments of memories from the day earlier, good or bad, 
and complaints or excitement for the day ahead..</p>
     
	     <p> Buzz.. your phone chirps cheerfully. A phone is the only 
thing that can be so cheerful and consistent all the time, well, atleast till the time it recieves so many 
messages at a strech that it can hardly decide how to buzz several times the same moment. So it emits a dragged out, 
broken record sound ending it with the usual cheeriness, much like a angry sweet girl who ends a harsh diatribe of 
something by an 'It's Okay' so sweet you melt. </p>
	      
	      <p>Not that a girl and phone are similar. Give me an angry outburst over 
a barrage of phone messages anytime. Logic demands of the phone to sound one buzz for every message, irrationality 
demands the girl to incinerate a situation with every ounce of intensity she has. I wonder who's successful. Messages 
on phone are something that bind you to a darb social contract. A girl's "creative self-expression" is a completely 
different matter. Silence, on the phone is an unacceptable breach of contract,silence in a girl's diatribe is a 
gesture of great understanding and patient listening. It's something that frees you from necessarily using all 
of your faculties and senses in a conversation. When a girl is angry and talking, it is an ideal time for 
contemplation of the deepest thoughts. Its a state of heightened consciousness where you can wander everywhere 
without losing track of what the girl is talking about. For you, it is meditation, for her it is therapy.</p>

<p>It has been a great journey from there to here in a very short time. I have gotten to know a lot about the human psyche, 
especially the replacement scheme our minds are frought with. Conventional bounds of society andmarriage shielded people 
from working upon the replacement scheme, but recent humanitarian deeds forwardness has opened the floodgates for such behaviour. 
Hubba Hubba all fall down please!!!!
