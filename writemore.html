	      <br>
      <p>This started as an answer to ‘Why didn’t I Write More’, but by the time it finished, it started taking shape of ‘What I Write’, or the bar that I 
	set to publish what I write. 
      </p>




	<p>I have been in interviews where I was asked why I don't have a blog where I write steadily. While I tried to explain how writing for someone else 
	was vastly different from writing from a personal vantage point, or trying to communicate the process I put my thoughts through, it was a fruitless exercise.
  	It's difficult to explain to people that proof of work, especially in heavily abstracted tasks such as writing, doesn’t need to be visible. 
	It just needs to be verifiable.
	</p>

        <p>A brand, or a company, has its own life, and its own value statement. There, I can focus on the craft of writing much more than the philosophy, 
	as I am working on someone else's vision. Writing is convergent, hence easier. 
	Tempting as it was to develop some random blog, I didn't really have much to say. Everything I thought about, was a work in progress. 
	People don't understand work in progress. Anyway, for better or for worse:
	</p>

	<blockquote>"To demonstrate persuasively that you will not sacrifice principles for victory, you have to lose."</blockquote>




	<p>So here, I intend to clarify my stand.</p>


	<p>I should say why I don't publish more, but then writing without publishing is like keeping a ship in the harbor, so as good as not writing.</p>


	<p>The most obvious reason is there is far, far too much better stuff written out there, which people ought to read before they read something I 
	end up writing. This especially applies to good quality, specific non-fiction, because it is largely immutable with time.
	The only thing that qualifies me(or anyone else for that matter) to write non-fiction is a unique foray into hitherto uncharted territory 
	or creating a drastically different/better interpretations of established paradigms. 
	</p>




	
	<h4>Value and Purpose</h4>
	      
	<p>I need my writing to be valuable enough. It should serve a purpose in some way:</p>
	<ol type="1">
	<li>Explaining myself to people who may choose to invest in me, both personally and professionally. Creating an authentic representation of my thought process.
		</li>

	<li>Invoking genuine emotions in a constructive way. A way that either achieves something or soothes someone or provides an understanding of the complexities 
	   of the human condition and its interactions with the current times. (Fiction)
		</li>
	
	<li>Making a strong impact on someone's life, making them challenge the status quo of their self-narrative. invoking some spark they already have in them that 
	   makes them aware of a higher plane, as so many authors made in my life. (Non-fiction, Philosophy)
		</li>

	<li>Move the edge of infinity of knowledge an infinitesimal bit further or make existing knowledge clearer and more concrete.
		<li>


	<li>Be a part of a cohort of my generation that plays the long game of informing culture, avoiding harsh jumps that cause undue upheaval in the social fabric.
	    (Novels, Good Movies, basically sandboxes for experimenting with new cultural ideas, instead of ferociously clinging to age old ideas(rightists) or 
	    childishly seeking to upend every single aspect of society without reason.
		</li>


	<li>Anything that creates a true or truer picture about the world with a slight, but unashamed bias towards optimism. Say a 51-49 optimism to pessimism 
	    mix in my realism. Those 2 points on 100 make all the difference in the world.
		</li>
		</ol>



	<p>In my extensive reading, most of the stuff people consume is useless. Be it the soulless comedy you laugh so much at but then immediately feel empty about,
        or the drab drivel that passes as non-fiction these days, a sad rearrangement of the same mediocre ideas from pop culture.
	One may argue that the things I am critical about are valuable, that everyone is entitled to do whatever they want, and that value is subjective.
	While I agree with the 'do whatever you want' part I totally disagree with the other arguments.
		</p>

	<p>Value is objective and intrinsic. Not even success is enough to determine the quality of something.
		

	So I draw a line, stand by it, and leave the rest to Providence.
	</p>



	<h4>Ideas and Plants</h4>

	<p>Ideas are like plants.<br>

	Cutting a plant too soon might serve some purpose but the plant has a much higher potential of creating an impact if left alone to evolve and mature. 
	Especially if it has the genotype of a tree. And the best thing is that this happens effortlessly, in the background, while you are living your routine life.
		</p>

	<p>Allowing ideas to mull in the catalysts of time and experience allows them to become clearer and more formidable. More often, you realize their foolishness, 
	which is even more desirable.
	</p>


	<p>This is me being heavy on metaphors, but I cannot resist making a haiku.

	<blockquote>
		The ship in the harbor rots,<br>
		But a tree<br>
		Uncut and attended, thrives..
	</blockquote>
	</p>








<h4>It’s Difficult</h4>

If I am writing about a topic, and in due research, I come across someone who has already covered that topic comprehensively, I will prefer to share the link to their work rather than being a middleman and putting an undeserved set of ideas to my name.


Then, there’s the divergence you encounter while writing something. 
Ideas are like fissile materials. Put any energy into one and it splits into multiple offshoots. Sustain this process and you end up simultaneously working on 25 ideas and have 200 references you need to study to make reasonable justice to what you started with.

Add to that the expanding length of the piece you are writing; the challenge of shrinking it, and making it precise, all the while ensuring that the language isn't what you understand, but what others should be able to.

In conclusion, Analytical Writing is extremely difficult, if you insist on doing it right.



Fourthly, and this part is a bit tricky
<h4>Debugging and Refactoring</h4>

Society is like a huge codebase of insurmountable complexity.
Human progress, across all dimensions, is basically the world moving forward,
each generation reading in the progress made till that point in time, refactoring it, debugging it wherever necessary, even deleting the functions that no longer make sense, and writing new functions as needed.
(*Apologies to coders for the crude appropriation of terms, and to non-coders for using obscure terminology. To non-coders, the terms are a valuable addition to your worldview)



When instead of debugging, people start trying to build a new codebase, clefts appear in the whole psyche.
(Gall's law of Designing Systems)



(Imagine the horror if the codebase is exposed to people who don’t know anything about coding. Wait, it is.)

Now, these clefts are very important. They force out the bugs in the original code, thus enabling us to debug them.

But often, they themselves create so many new bugs in the social code, that their costs outweigh their benefits.

Marxism, Critical Race Theory, Salafi Fundamentalism and movements in response to that i.e Zionism, some components of Hindu nationalism, for those in India, Demonitization in 2016)


In my generation, the freedom, and the entitlement to a voice that this freedom has afforded, has turned people into stupid brats.


And I am always starkly aware of the vantage point I am speaking from, and the effort and sacrifice on the part of so many people it took to reach here.

So, I often go down the rabbit holes of reading and understanding why things are the way they are, rather than hastily putting out half-baked ideas that seem popular and intelligent at the moment, and generate mass traction easily.

There is a lot of stuff that is going through that process I call work in progress.









I had always had an overwhelming amount of thought.

Ratio of the words I have written to the words I have read.

Let's call it word output ratio. (WOR)

My WOR should approach zero during my lifetime.
This self-affirmation allows me to keep my opinions in perspective.

Most writing out there has a very high Word Output Ratio.
Even when people have a decent WOR, they are muddied by biases and they are blind to it.

(I definitely have biases, but I have an elaborate system of checks and balances to even them out.
Biases are good. All quality is reached by biases.
But like in an individual, so in a society, there ought to be checks and balances. I will never perhaps get rid of biases. Maybe no one can. But we can always strive to be Less Wrong(link)
A good starting point is to grok this whole blog. Should take ~2 exclusive years)

Especially due to the internet, it has become very easy to appear to have a low WOR.

But sooner or later, the chinks and lack of depth shows, especially when people are fishing for more followers and have other populist machinations to pursue instead of robust and genuine inquiry.


Lastly, the concept of a-priori and a-posteriori.
Some quotes have made home in my mind.

Naval.
"I was always ready to share, but before external success, nobody cared to listen."


NNT:
"If you want to be a philosopher-king, start by being a king."


To add to it, another quote, by Herodotus,
"Knowledge gives weight, but achievements give luster. And a lot more people see than weigh.





Philosophy and action is like the chicken and egg problem.
Some people flout ideas as inconsequential, philosophy to be a waste of time. But philosophy is an integral part of progress, especially when you have to ascertain the long-term consequences of actions.

That makes philosophy inseparable from action.

Having said that, I have no doubt that philosophy can be inherently valuable even if who it originates from is not a part of the action. After all, civilization is one long relay race from one generation to the next, with one random person developing the theory and some other person, separated by time, executing it.




There is a case for the writing itself potentially being a step to the success that qualifies it. I started this website to cover that possibility.

So what I currently write about constitutes the a-priori stuff.
Stuff elaborating  _my_ inclinations and intentions, rather than any discourse or advice.

Stuff that will create a path to help achieve the things I want to.
